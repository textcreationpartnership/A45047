            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM by the Kings Command to tell you, That He hath conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the humble Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the City of <hi>London,</hi> where ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and other Eminent Citizens are of undoubted Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and Affection to His Service, That for their ſakes His Majeſty will ſhew the City all the Favour they can reaſonably deſire.</p>
                        <p>It was very long before His Majeſty took Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to queſtion their Charter: It was not the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Diſcourſes of the Coffee-Houſes, the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Pamphlets, and Libels daily Publiſhed and Diſperſed thence into all Parts of the Kingdom, the Outragious Tumults in the Streets, nor the Aftronts to His Courts of Juſtice could provoke Him to it.</p>
                        <p>His Majeſty had Patience until Diſorders were grown to that height, That nothing leſs ſeemed to be Deſigned than a Ruine to the Government both of Church and State; For the Factious Party were not content with the Practice of theſe Inſolencies, but endeavoured to have them publiquely counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the Magiſtrates, and for that end in all Elections they ſtickled to Chuſe the moſt diſaffected
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97052:4"/>
                           <!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->into Offices of the greateſt Truſt in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and carried themſelves with that Heat and Violence, That it was a Terror to all ſober and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Citizens; And the City was ſo unhappily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Parties, That there was no likelihood it could return to good Order, ſo long as the Factious retained any hopes of procuring the Election of Magiſtrates of their own Party, for their impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                        <p>It was high time to put a Stop to this growing Evil. This made it Neceſſary for His Majeſty to enquire into their Abuſe of Franchiſes, that it might be in His Power to make a Regulation ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Reſtore the City to its former good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                        <p>It was not for Puniſhment, but meerly for the Good of the City that He took this Courſe.</p>
                        <p>And now the King hath obtained Judgment in a <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> it is not His Intention to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice them, either in their Properties or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms. Nay, leſt the Entring a Judgment upon Record might have Conſequences Fatal to them, His Majeſty was ſo tender of them, That He cauſed Mr. Attorney to forbear the ſame at preſent, that the City might have ſome time to conſider their own Condition.</p>

                        <p>His Majeſties Affection to the City is too great to reject their Suit for that Cauſe.</p>
                        <p>But for that Reaſon you will have the leſs time to deliberate upon the Particulars the King doth require of you.</p>
                        <p>And indeed, There will be little need of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; For His Majeſty hath reſolved to make the Alterations as few and as eaſie, as may be conſiſtent with the good Government of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Peace of the Kingdom.

                        <p>If His Majeſty ſhall in like manner diſapprove the Perſons choſen to be Sheriffs, or either of them, His Majeſty may appoint Perſons to be Sheriffs for the enſuing Year, by His Commiſſion, if He ſo Pleaſe.</p>
